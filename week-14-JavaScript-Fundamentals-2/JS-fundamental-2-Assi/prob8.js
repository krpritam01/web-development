// Prob 8. Let's say you are working for an event management company. As a web developer, you need to build a countdown timer for an upcoming event. You need to build a function that calculates the number of days between the current date and the event's start date.

function calculateRemainingDays(eventDate) {
    const currentDate = new Date();
    const eventDateTime = new Date(eventDate);

    const timeDifference = eventDateTime - currentDate;
    const daysRemaining = Math.ceil(timeDifference / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
    return daysRemaining;
}

const eventDate = '2023-10-01'
console.log(calculateRemainingDays(eventDate));

Output: 30
