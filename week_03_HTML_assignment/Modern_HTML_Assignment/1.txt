1. List out the features of HTML5.

Ans : HTML5, the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language, introduced several new features and enhancements to the web development. 

		Here are some key features of HTML5:

=>Semantic Markup: HTML5 introduced new semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <footer>, <section>, <article>, etc., allowing developers to provide more meaningful structure and context to the content.

=>Canvas element - HTML5 introduced the <canvas> element, which allows for dynamic, interactive graphics to be created and manipulated within a web page.

=>Improved Multimedia Support: HTML5 provides native support for audio and video elements, eliminating the need for third-party plugins like Flash. It introduced the <audio> and <video> elements, which make it easier to embed multimedia content directly into web pages.

=>Geolocation API - HTML5 provides an API for obtaining the user's location, enabling web applications to
    offer location-based services.

=>Local Storage - HTML5 introduced the localStorage API, which allows for the storage of data on the user's
    device, improving performance and reducing the need for round-trips to the server.

=>New Structural Elements -  HTML5 introduced new semantic elements such as <header>, <footer>, <nav>, and <article> that make it easier to structure and organise content on a web page.

=>Form Improvements - HTML5 introduced several improvements to forms, including new input types like date,time, and colour, as well as new attributes such as required and autofocus.

=>Accessibility improvements - HTML5 provides better support for accessibility, including the ability to
provide alternative text for images and improved support for screen readers.

=>Drag and Drop: HTML5 introduced native support for drag and drop functionality, making it easier to implement intuitive user interfaces that allow users to drag elements and drop them into designated areas.
