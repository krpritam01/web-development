1. Improved Accessibility: Semantic tags provide meaningful structure and allow assistive technologies, such as screen readers, to better understand and navigate the content.

2. Better Code Readability and Maintainability: Semantic tags make the HTML code more readable and understandable, both for developers and future maintainers of the code. The use of descriptive semantic tags, such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, and <article>, helps in quickly grasping the purpose and organization of the content. This makes it easier to maintain and update the codebase in the long run.

3. Consistent Styling and Design: Semantic tags provide a solid foundation for consistent styling and design across different webpages.
