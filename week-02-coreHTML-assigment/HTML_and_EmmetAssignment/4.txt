Ans: There are 3 tags which we have learn in this module are:

1.<h1> </h1>- The heading tag is used to define the main heading or title of a section or page.h1 represents the highest level of the Headings.
For Example: <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>

2.<img> - The image tag is used to insert images into an HTML document. It is a self-closing tag, meaning it does not require a closing tag.
For Example:<a href="https://www.example.com">Click here</a>

3. <div> - The div tag is a generic container element used to group and organize other elements within an HTML document. It does not have any semantic meaning  but provides a way to apply styling, apply classes or IDs for CSS and JavaScript manipulation, and structure the layout of a webpage.
For Example:
<div>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
  <img src="path/to/image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
</div>
